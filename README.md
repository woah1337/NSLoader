# Tutorial
(Optional): you can compile BlackBone from source too, select win32 and release to compile, copy the .lib file to the InjectLib folder and rename it to BlackBone.x86.lib<br/>
(Optional)First compile InjectLib.dll as release x86 (or download from releases if you don't want to compile).<br/>
Edit Settings.cs in the loader.<br/>
If you get an error while opening a form, compile the loader first, close the form and open the form again (you only need to do this once, this is because of the NetSeal theme.)<br/>
Compile the loader.<br/>
Put InjectLib.dll in the same folder as your loader.<br/>
(Optional): Make an SFX if you want only 1 binary for your loader like loader.exe not loader.exe and InjectLib.dll.<br/>
Run your loader : )<br/>
